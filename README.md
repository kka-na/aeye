# Autonomous License Project - VACS
This repository contains code for the **Inha University autonomous license project**.  

The project is divided into three seperate modules which are logically linked via ROS.

Project details will be continuously updated. ðŸ˜¸

## Milestones ðŸ‘·
Semi-major fixes
**Hardware Fixes**
- [ ] SCC Radar seperation (Radar module must be seperated from vehicle CAN. Radar -> Cable Block -> Vehicle Can)
- [ ] Speaker installation (Speakers must be installed in a location where volume or on/off control is not possible)
**Software Fixes**
- [ ] BSD distance adjustments (Front and back)
- [ ] Limit lane change conditions (Disable lane change when road curvature is above threshold)
- [ ] Driver TOR (take over request) (TOR when two wheels depart lane)
- [ ] AEB distance adjustments (ACC distance should be fixed to level 4)
- [ ] Enable autonomous mode only when lane lines are visible
- [ ] TOR logging + Fix delay
- [ ] TOR visual + auditory alert 

### Finished Tasks (excluding paper workðŸ’¦)
1. LiDAR BSD
2. Fix CAN Error
3. E-STOP button
4. Merge CAN modules
5. SCC speed and mode change
6. Turn off driver monitoring
7. Turn off UI
8. Error checking (LiDAR, Camera, INS, RTK)
9. VACS (UI Module)
10. HW Installation (Lattepanda, Nuvo, E Stop, Light)
11. CAN (RPM, Steering, Gear)
12. Logging
